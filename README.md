A BMI:

4. of 30 or over is obese

**How the BMI is calculated**

The BMI calculation divides the weight in kilograms (kg) by their height in metres (m) squared.

For example, if you weigh 70kg (around 154 pounds) and are 1.73m (around 5 feet 8 inches or 173cm) tall, you work out your BMI by:

1. squaring your height: 1.73x1.73 = 2.99
2. dividing 70 by 2.99 = 23.41137

+ If value for weight is entered in pounds, it converts to kg by a multiplying factor of 0.4536
+ If value for height is entered in centimeters, it converts to meters by dividing by 100
+  If value for height is entered in feets and inches, it converts to meters by first converting feets to inches by multiplying by 12, add the result to the value of inches then multiply the sum by a factor of 0.0254
+  Your result will be displayed to 2 decimal place, for example 23.41.
+  Based on the result and the range it falls in, it suggests food, vegetables and fruits that can be taken to either add weight, maintain weight or reduce weight.
