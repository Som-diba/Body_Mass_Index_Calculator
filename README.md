**Redi Project**

This is a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator. The Body Mass Index of an individual is a numerial value or measure that uses the height and the weight to work out and access whether the individual has a healthy body weight relative to their height.

The BMI does not take into account other factors such as muscle mass, body composition, age, health challenges and so on. It is always recommended to consult a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment of an individual's health.

The output of this calculator returns if you underweight, normal weight, overwight or obese. Based on the output and  the age of the individual, it suggests food, vegetables and fruits that can be taken to either add weight, maintain weight or reduce weight.
